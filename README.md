# Monomix

### The future of electronic music collaboration, discovery, and monetisation.

Monomix unifies the fragmented electronic music ecosystem into one platform connecting artists, DJs, and fans through multiple monetisation channels. By empowering artists to earn from track sales, remix bounties, live bookings, and selling lessons Monomix creates strong engagement incentives that drive both user and platform growth.

The more artists succeed, the more Monomix thrives — generating authentic adoption and a self-sustaining financial flywheel built on mutual benefit and global scalability.
