MONOMIX
Redefining Music 
Collaborate. Remix. Monetise.
Executive Summary:
Monomix is an all-in-one digital platform that unites the fragmented electronic music industry. It empowers artists to collaborate, share, and monetise their work while fans can create community and discover new sounds - all within a single, purpose-built environment. By combining multiple tools and monetisation options, Monomix creates a sustainable, scalable ecosystem for the electronic music community.
Revenue Generation: both subscriptions and commissions.
Free access: Free users can discover and purchase music, follow artists, and chat to other members with similar tastes, fostering a social community and providing a free gateway.
Basic subscription: For an accessible monthly subscription users can begin to monetise. Basic subs can list tracks for sale, request or apply for remixes, or sell lessons. They can also earn a small commission on any tracks that are bought through their playlist. Monomix takes a commission on all sales made.
Pro subscription: For a higher fee users become “pro” verified (with a blue tick) increasing their exposure and verification. Monomix also takes less commissions on their sales providing a financial incentive for big artists to upgrade. Pro subs will also get a larger % of sales made through their playlist.
The Problem: Fragmentation in the Music Industry
Today’s online electronic music scene is scattered across multiple platforms- collaboration tools, distribution services, education platforms, and fan communities all operate separately. This fragmentation creates inefficiency, reduces creative opportunity, and limits artists’ earning potential. 
The Monomix Solution
Monomix solves this by bringing every aspect of music creation and monetisation under one roof.
·        Remix Hub: Long overdue in the music industry, the Remix Hub is purpose-built to streamline the remixing process.. Artists can request or apply for remixes, agree on the remix bounty, upload and share stems, and handle all legal and financial agreements- all directly within Monomix. By providing a workflow for the most time-consuming and uncertain parts of remix collaborations, Monomix turns what was once a messy, informal process into a smooth, transparent, and rewarding experience for both creators and remixers inspiring more collaboration between artists and revenue opportunities for all.
·    Track Distribution: Artists can upload their tracks directly on the platform for sale with Monomix v1. We will then work with distributors to have releases automatically uploaded for sale on Monomix. The marketplace will be within the social hub. 
·    Booking Artists and Finding Venues: Venues and promoters will be able to discover artists who are available in their city and book them directly on Monomix. Artists can find gigs without middlemen increasing their cut of the revenue. Venues can create playlists and connections on Monomix allowing the people who will love their events to find them more easily.
·        Lessons Terminal: The Lessons Terminal creates a powerful new revenue stream for artists by allowing them to teach their craft directly to fans and aspiring producers. Through live 1:1 sessions, group classes, and pre-recorded masterclasses, artists can monetise their expertise while building deeper connections with their audience. This direct interaction not only strengthens artist-fan relationships but also fosters a vibrant learning community within the Monomix ecosystem.
·       Discovery and Community: Fans and DJs can explore the newest tracks, remixes, and emerging artists in a social environment that encourages connection and conversation. By blending discovery with community engagement, Monomix gives artists a powerful way to grow their following organically to generate another source of income. If tracks were discovered and purchased through someone’s playlist they get a cut of the commission for that sale incentivising artists to bring their fans to Monomix.
Market Opportunity
Monomix is uniquely positioned to unify the fragmented electronic music ecosystem. By focusing on artist revenue — from track sales, lessons/masterclasses, playlist purchases, and remix bounties — we create strong incentives for engagement, which in turn drives Monomix’s financial growth. This approach is designed to ensure profitability from day one, leveraging adoption, engagement, and multiple revenue streams while building a global, sustainable community.
